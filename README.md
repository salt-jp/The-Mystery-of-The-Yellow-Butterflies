# The-Mystery-of-the-Yellow-Butterflies
Two novels have been rearanged and resorted: "Yellow Butterflies" by Mary Raymond Shipman Andrews, and "The Mystery of the Sycamore" by Carolyn Wells. These novels were chosen for their symbolic titles, and that the titles could be combined to create something just as pretty as their respective predecessors. Some of the english is understadable, but some is not. There were almost 80,000 different words for the code to scramble and reconfigure.

Instead of downloading the .txt file of the novels, I decided to copy the text direclty into colab notebook, so it looks insane; but it does work regarldess. One thing I'd change would definitley be just to use the .txt file to make my code not look huge. Also--the code itself produce 50,000 words, but when converting it into the .pdf file, it has a little trouble converting all 50,000 words, so the .pdf example is a little shorter that 50,000.
