# The-Mystery-of-the-Yellow-Butterflies
Two novels have been rearanged and resorted: "Yellow Butterflies" by Mary Raymond Shipman Andrews, and "The Mystery of the Sycamore" by Carolyn Wells. These novels were chosen for their symbolic titles that combined nicely together. Ironically, even though the title sounds graceful, the novel I created with this code does not read pretty, and actually reads more like gibberish. Some of the english is understadable, but some is not. I thought that the "gibberish" was much more enjoyable than creating a somewhat comprehensive story, so that is why this nice sounding novel is actually quite silly. Every result has something new and funny that makes me laugh, so I think this was a relavivley succesful project. This code prints over 50,000 words each time it is run and the specific .pdf linked in this repository has 69,940 words.
Instead of downloading the .txt file of the novels, I decided to copy the text direclty into colab notebook, so it looks a little weird; but it does work regarldess. One thing I'd change would definitley be just to use the .txt file to make my code not look huge.
