# The-Mystery-of-the-Yellow-Butterflies
Two novels have been rearanged and resorted: "Yellow Butterflies" by Mary Raymond Shipman Andrews, and "The Mystery of the Sycamore" by Carolyn Wells. These novels were chosen for their symbolic titles, and that the titles could be combined to create something just as pretty as their respective predecessors. Some of the english is understadable, but some is not. There were almost 80,000 different words for the code to scramble and reconfigure.
